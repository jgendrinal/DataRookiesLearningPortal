# title: README

This document aims to collect Data Science resources and tie them together into logical and comprehensive learning paths. Most resources are either product-promoting, or product-specific. They tend to push people to learn in a direction best suited to using their package, framework, or language of choice. The content here will help you learn data science to meet *your* goals.
